# Piper TTS Settings (FR-07)
# IMPORTANT: Update these paths to your local Piper setup
PIPER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/piper"  # Example path, replace with your actual Piper executable path
PIPER_VOICES_DIR="/path/to/your/piper-voices/" # Example path, replace with your Piper voices directory

# Default Piper voice model (file name within PIPER_VOICES_DIR, without .onnx extension usually, or full name)
# FR-07: Default Piper (fr-siwis / fr-gilles)
DEFAULT_PIPER_VOICE_MODEL="fr_FR-siwis-medium" # Example: "fr_FR-siwis-medium.onnx" or just "fr_FR-siwis-medium"
# Ensure the corresponding .onnx and .onnx.json files are in PIPER_VOICES_DIR

# Audio settings (Defaults are in config.py, uncomment to override)
# PIPER_VOICE_NATIVE_SAMPLE_RATE=22050 # Native sample rate of the Piper voice model (e.g., fr-siwis is 22050 Hz)
# AUDIO_OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE=24000       # Target output sample rate for audio streamed to client (e.g., 24kHz as per Req Doc)
# If these differ, resampling will occur.

# Logging Level (Optional - default is typically INFO or DEBUG in logging_config.py)
